*Introduction*

In this project we will be creating an Air bnb style holiday home booking web application. This will provide a secure environment for Hosts to advertise their properties and be more selective in accepting Guests.

Hosts can sign up in order to add listings to the web application. They can place listings with a property description and a detailed spec. They provide dates when the property is available.

As a Guests looking for a place to stay, they can request a booking for Hosts to review before they decide to accept.

This is a more cost-effective way for both Users. For Hosts this cuts out third party holiday brokers and ensures that their properties are being rented out to reputable Guests. For Guests this provides a service that finds them an affordable holiday home in areas away from traditional locales.

*Goals*

- Reliable booking system
- Clear UI
- Attractive UI (Beautify)
- Clean code (SRP, DRY)
